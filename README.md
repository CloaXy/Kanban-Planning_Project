# Semester Project Planning Kanban Board
Welcome to the Semester Project Planning Kanban Board! This repository serves as a centralized hub for planning and organizing various projects throughout the semester. Utilizing the Kanban methodology, I aim to streamline the project management process, ensuring clarity, efficiency, and effective planning.

# Overview
For all or most of the projects scheduled during the semester, this repository will serve as a central point for planning and coordination. Each individual project has its own dedicated repository, linked to this overview repository for planning purposes. Project repositories will contain code, documentation, and other project-specific resources, while this overview repository will focus on high-level planning and coordination.

# Repository Structure
Linked Repositories
Project Repositories: Each project has its own dedicated repository. These repositories are linked to this overview repository to facilitate planning and tracking due dates.
# Branches
Master Branch: This branch contains the main project overview and serves as the entry point for navigating through different projects.
# README.md Files
Master README: The main README file located in the master branch provides an overview of the repository, including instructions on navigation and usage.
# Project Management Workflow
Initiation: A new project is identified, and a project repository is created. The project repository is then linked to this overview repository for planning purposes.
Planning: Tasks and milestones for the project are outlined on the project board within the project repository. Due dates and progress tracking are managed within the project repository's Kanban board.
Execution: I work on assigned tasks within the project repository, moving them through the Kanban board columns as progress is made.
Review: Regular reviews are conducted within the project repository to assess progress, identify any blockers or issues, and make necessary adjustments to the project plan.
Completion: Upon completion of the project, final documentation and deliverables are updated within the project repository. The project repository's status is then updated within this overview repository.
# Collaboration Guidelines
Communication: Effective communication is key. I utilize project-specific communication channels within the project repository for discussing ideas, providing feedback, and sharing updates.
Documentation: Comprehensive documentation accompanies each project within its dedicated repository, including README.md files with clear instructions, explanations, and any necessary resources or references.
# Repository Maintenance
Regular Updates: This overview repository will be regularly updated to reflect the latest status of all linked project repositories.
Archiving: Completed projects will be archived within their respective repositories to maintain a clean and organized structure.
# Conclusion
This Semester Project Planning Kanban Board, linked to individual project repositories, is designed to facilitate efficient project management and planning throughout the semester. By adhering to the outlined workflow and guidelines, I aim to deliver high-quality projects while maintaining an organized development environment.

Thank you for your interest in my projects! Let's make this semester a successful one.
