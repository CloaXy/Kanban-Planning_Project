# CMPG323_Overview-34416579
For all or most of the projects that will be done during the semester, I will try to utilize mostly the Overview repository that has been created. I will then use branches to add the different code and different READMe.md files where I will describe how the project works and how everything is done during that specific project.
If a project requires that it's own repository needs to be created because of the amount of pranches that the project needs or whatever the reason, I will create a new repository, but keep on updating the overview repository to make sure that all the tasks and information about them are up to date.

# Branching Strategy
Project 2: During project 2, there will be a main branch which will contain all the information concerning how the project is done. There will also be other sub-branches that will contain the code and information used in SQL Server, and another branch that will contain the code for the API where I will mostlikely use Visual Studio 2022.

Project 3: For this project another repository will most likely be create that will explain how the program works in the main branch's README.md file. There will then be other branches that will contain the code for the different files that is needed to run the program, each also with a README.md file that explains the code and what happens.

Project 4: A new repository will be created for this project where there will be README.md file that explains how the report is to be used and how the UI Automation will work. There will also be reference list within one of the branches created to give there sites visited their credit.

Project 5:In project 5, a new repository will be created and once again a main branch to explain what the project is about and other different branches to explain what is done and how everything works. A reference list will also be given in one of the branches' README.md file make sure that all the visited sites are referenced.

# .gitignore
For each of these projects there may ne files and screenshots or other code which did not work exactly that I do not need in the working version of a program, but which I will still save to keep as proof of what was done. Those file directories will be put into a .gitignore file to make sure that it will not be used.

# Storage of sensitive information
For the storage of sensitive information, I will also create a folder of documents that I need for in case my credentials or sensitive information is asked. I can have restricted access on these folders and files and make sure that they are not public.
